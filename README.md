# new-tab-page

A productivity focused new tab page extension for Google Chrome.
Includes:
- Weather taken from openweathermap.org (an api key will need to be added to the assets.json file for this to work)
- Quotes from either the Internet Chuck Norris Database, or Twitter (given a twitter handle)
- Quick Launch keyboard shortcuts (can be configured in user-settings.json)
- Notepad (content will not be deleted between relaunches)
